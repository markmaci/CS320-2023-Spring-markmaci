//
Given a list of integers xs, list_grouping(xs)
returns a list of pairs (n, x) where n indicates
the number of times x occurs in xs; for each x in
xs, there must be a pair (n, x) for some n in the
returned list.
//
For instance,
list_grouping([1,2]) = [[1,1], [1,2]]
list_grouping([1,2,2,2,1]) = [[2,1], [3,2]]
list_grouping([1,2,1,2,3]) = [[2,1], [2,2], [1,3]]
//
In order to receive full credit, your implementation
should be able to handle a list containing 1M elements
in less than 10 seconds (mine can do it in less than
two seconds)

Some testing code:
Your implementation needs to be efficient to pass the
following test:
val N = 1000000
val nxs = list_grouping(int1_map_list(N, fn i => N-i))
